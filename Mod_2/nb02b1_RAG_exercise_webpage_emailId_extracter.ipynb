      "Anamaria Goltes shared a glimpse of the veggies and fruits the couple are growing in their kitchen garden. She shared a picture of strawberries and lettuce on her Instagram Stories and wrote in Slovenian, which translates to English as, “Strawberries and salad from our garden.” Her Story disappeared on Instagram but was picked up by a fan page, and fans of the Slovenian basketball player had a good laugh over it.Reacting to her update, a fan wrote, “You know he’s ordering Taco Bell as we speak be fr lmao.” Another said, “Man.. I don't want TOO skinny Luka. He can still get his burgers and beers please Ana!” One more joked, “Got that man eating straight air I’m crying.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A fan shared a meme of a man secretly eating packed food from the refrigerator and wrote, “Meanwhile, Luka, while she takes the pictures.” Giving credit to her for being the force behind his fitness, a fan wrote, “She's taking matters into her own hands lmao.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A comment also read: “I am excited to know how this change will affect his style of play.”Goltes is a model and seems to be accompanying Doncic in his fitness journey. He proposed to her in July 2023, and the couple welcomed a baby girl in December the same year. They have named her Gabriela.Doncic is not just looking fitter these days but also has solid plans for the offseason to keep himself active. The Dallas Mavericks have allowed him to play for his home team. However, the only condition is that he will be accompanied by a coach from the team.Also Read: Luka Doncic steps out to watch a game in Spain; fans comment on his slimmer look: “He loses weight in off-season then gains it back”This was Doncic’s first season with the Los Angeles Lakers after he was traded from the Dallas Mavericks in February.
